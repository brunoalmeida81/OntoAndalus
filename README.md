# OntoAndalus
OntoAndalus is an ontology about pottery artefacts of al-Andalus, a relevant topic in Islamic archaeological studies in Spain and Portugal. The purpose of OntoAndalus is to further knowledge in the domain and to allow for the development of a multilingual terminological resource in the Semantic Web, based on formal definitions or descriptions of concepts and other units of knowledge in the domain.

OntoAndalus is being developed in OWL and is presentely aligned with the [DOLCE+DnS Utltralite](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Ontology:DOLCE+DnS_Ultralite) top-level ontology.
